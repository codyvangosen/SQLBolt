# SQLBolt Learning Repository  
Practicing SQL fundamentals through SQLBolt’s interactive lessons

## 📘 Overview
This repository contains my structured walkthrough of the full SQLBolt curriculum  
(https://sqlbolt.com). The goal here is simple: create a clean, organized place to store  
my notes, practice exercises, and personal SQL solutions — written in my own style,  
with clear, human-readable comments and explanations.

SQLBolt teaches SQL through progressively more advanced lessons, and this repo mirrors  
that structure lesson-by-lesson.

- **exercises.sql** → The lesson’s practice prompts  
- **solutions.sql** → My completed SQL solutions, heavily commented

## 🧠 Learning Focus

The exercises progressively cover:
- Basic `SELECT` statements  
- Filtering with `WHERE`  
- Sorting and limiting results  
- Aggregation (`COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, etc.)  
- GROUP BY / HAVING  
- Multi-table JOINs  
- INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE  
- Table creation and constraints  
- Best practices in writing clean, readable SQL

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository
I built this repo to:
- Refresh and strengthen my SQL fundamentals  
- Keep a clean record of completed lessons  
- Demonstrate SQL proficiency in a portfolio-friendly way  
- Reinforce concepts by writing them out manually  
- Provide a reference I can revisit anytime  

Everything here is handwritten by me — no copied SQL, no boilerplate.  
The goal is accuracy, clarity, and deliberate practice.
